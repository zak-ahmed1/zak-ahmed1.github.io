title: Precision Agricultural UAV
description:  The Precision Agricultural Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) project was initiated during my work at Near East University Robotics Laboratory to design and develop a technologically based solution to the dispersion of pesticides, herbicides, and the fertilizing process in agriculture. To this end a fixed wing UAV was proposed. The image above shows a SolidWorks design for this UAV.
