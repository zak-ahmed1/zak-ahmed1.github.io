title: Heavy Load Delivery Drone
description:  The coaxial octocopter has been designed as a multirotor UAV for efficient and reliable parcel delivery within urban environments. It features eight motors arranged in a coaxial configuration, where pairs of motors are stacked on top of each other at four arms. This design provides increased thrust, stability, and redundancy, allowing the drone to carry payloads safely even in case of motor failure.
