title: Scaled-down Tilt-wing UAV
description:  Designed a scaled-down prototype of a Vertical Takeoff and Landing (VTOL) tiltwing Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) in SolidWorks to validate the concept. The prototype was mounted on a pitch and roll test bench to assess its stability before being flight-tested outdoors. The initial iteration demonstrated good roll control, but further modifications and experimentation were required to improve pitch stability.
